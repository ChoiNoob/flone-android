# FloneRemote
We're creating a new Drone remote controller, totally open source, and driven with performance in mind. Also, we'll try to connect it to the internet. So, you will be able to fly a drone that is really (really!) far away.

This is our goal:

And these are some pictures of the yet-flying totally open hardware drone:
